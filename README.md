<h1>Welcome to my gitHub!!</h1>

<p>I am David Thatcher, a self enployed Rolfer who is making the transition into the wonderful world of code!

I'm currently a self taught programmer, primarily in Javascript with exposure to React, Redux and Sagas, and some python experience.

  I'm in the midst of a Work Experience program at <b>GuideWire!!</b> 
  
  This is a pilot program that allows persons coming from a non-traditional
coding background to take an active role in their intern program. Through this I am working in an Agile work environment, 
specifically using Slack, Zoom, Trello and Miro to manage design and workflows. My role has been in helping design the initial buildout
 of the intern project, while working to modify an existing piece of software to use as an alternative to their build.  This means building
 the data model in MySQL, converting the backend to Kotlin Ktor Framework with Exposed, and modifying the frontend to match the new modeling (as well as updating dependencies to a
 stable version).
  
  If you would like to hear more about the itern project
and my specific role in it, feel free to reach out!<p>
