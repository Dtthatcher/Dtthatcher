<h1>Welcome to my gitHub!!</h1>

<p>My name is David Thatcher and I am a Junior Software Developer.
  
  Prior to developing, I was a self employed Rolfer in the greater NYC area. For 14 years I worked with people who had chronic
  pain and movement issues, addressing their structural holding patterns and creating action plans to get them back to living fulfilling and
  productive lives!
  
  I am a self taught programmer. My stack includes Kotlin for serverside development, Javascript (React) for my frontend UI, and MySQL
  for data persistance. 
  
  Currently I am training in Kotlin Android development, as well as Jetpack Compose to create multiplatform apps that utilize a common codebase,
  and the AWS Cloud Architect track through ACloudGuru.com

  In August of this 2021 I finished a Work Experience Program with Guidewire.
  
  This was a pilot program that allows persons coming from a non-traditional
  coding background to take an active role in their intern program. Through this I was working in an Agile work environment, 
  specifically using Slack, Zoom, Trello and Miro to manage design and workflows. My role was helping design the initial buildout
  of the intern project, while working to modify an existing piece of software to use as an alternative to their build.  This meant building
  the data model in MySQL, converting the backend web server to Kotlin Ktor Framework with Exposed, 
  and modifying the frontend to match the new modeling (as well as updating dependencies to  a
  stable version).
  
  I am excited for this new chapter and look forward to linking up with you!
