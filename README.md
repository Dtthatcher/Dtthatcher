<h1>Welcome to my gitHub!!</h1>

<p>I am David Thatcher, a self enployed Rolfer who is making the transition into the wonderful world of code!

I'm currently a self taught programmer, primarily in Javascript with exposure to React, Redux and Sagas, and some python experience.

I'm in the midst of a Work Experience program at GuideWire!! This is a pilot program that allows persons coming from a non-traditional
coding background take an active role in their intern program. Through this I am learning how to work in an Agile work environment, 
specifically using Slack, Zoom, Trello and Miro to manage design and workflows. If you would like to hear more about the itern project
and my specific role in it, feel free to reach out!<p>
