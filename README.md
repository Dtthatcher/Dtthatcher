<h1>Welcome to my gitHub!!</h1>

<p>My name is David Thatcher and I am a Android Engineer.
  
  Prior to developing, I was a self employed Rolfer in the greater NYC area. For 14 years I worked with people who had chronic
  pain and movement issues, addressing their structural holding patterns and creating action plans to get them back to living fulfilling and
  productive lives!
  
  I write mostly in Kotlin, with experience in Java.  I also have Javascript/React experience.
  Currently I like to create my apps in Jetpack Compose, using an MVVM architecture (although I'm using more and more MVI) and Flows.
